# AWS_Cloud_Robotics_Architecture
Thesis project for the Master's Degree program in Mechatronic Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. 

The aim of this project was to design a cloud robotic architecture for fleet management using only AWS services. The proposed solution is made by three main components: the single robot application in which three TurtleBot3 have been developed, the multi robotic application that contains the fleet manager software, and a REST API that display in a web page the different robots status.

The following project has been used as source for the single robot development phase: https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-sample-application-helloworld.git. The ROS nodes rotate.py havw been modified according to the proposed architecture
